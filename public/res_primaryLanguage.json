    "description": "Hi there! My name is Araceli Garcia and I have a background in Hospitality and Hotel Management. However, in 2022 I got a job at a tech oriented company and being surrounded by so many tech professionals has made me want to be part of the vibrant and ever evolving tech community. Nowadays technology is almost everywhere and it will conquer all industries in the upcoming years, so from a pragmatic point of view, it is a great career path to take. From a ‘passion’ point of view, new technologies are emerging on a weekly basis and it is amazing what the human being is accomplishing and, to be honest, I want to be a part of it and contribute to it somehow. I have been told that I don’t fit into the stereotypical tech profile as I have always held customer-oriented positions, but I would say that is my biggest strength: I feel as comfortable behind the laptop as I do interacting with the customer.",

      "description": "This is the first big project I had to work on. It was known by former students as the 'infamous salmon cookies' and it lived up to its title. The styling is definitely not its strongest point, but the usage of JavsScript and DOM manipulation certainly is. It may seem easy for an expert dev, but for one that has just started his/her dev journey it is definitely the 'infamous salmon cookies', a true soul-crusher and mind-bender.",

I used cards to display the animals and then a modal that allows you to display animals that only have 1, 2, 3 or 100 horns, which are the avaiable options. I also loved playing with Bootstrap here.",
